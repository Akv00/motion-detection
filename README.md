# motion-detection

This project uses several libraries of python to detect the motion of the hand or anything that camera captures

It creates contours of the image captured and can follow the path of the motion 

It uses numpy library to create the contours using the array matrix and cv2 library to change the amount of area to be considered for detection of motion.

It uses pyautogui to create a interface that will create windows for image input and contours drawing and motion detection
